## **Generator 1:** what does this generate?

this one was the practice generator so i messed around with the basic
settings from the starter code and added a few new things to generate
rectangles with cute little spider eyes

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

The most important qualities is that the shapes are cute! the interesting qualities are how different individual shapes can be different and mutate from eachother
as well as a few interesting examples in the landmarks

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

Size controls how big each individual is

aspectRatio controls the aspect ratio of the individual rects
as well as affecting how bouncy the individuals are

angle also has a hand in the bouncing but mainly it changes the angles the individuals are at

hue changes the colors of the rects

brightness changes the light/dark range of the color of the individuals

these are relevant to this project because the idea is to be able to generate different types of content and the use of these sliders allows us to adjust the content and also allows attributes to be selected randomly.

## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

InCaseYouHaventNoticedImWeirdImaWeirdoIDontFitInandIDontWanttoFitInHaveYouEverSeenMeWithoutThisStupidHatonThatsWeird,
are my five+ landmarks
they differ from eachother by showcasing the different kinds of shapes that can be generated when experimenting with the different values for each of the dna properties,
some of the ways I experimented with them are obvious due to their name being "aspect"test but for the others
I chose funny names that I felt fit their look.

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things _can't_ it generate?

It can't generate things Other than spider-eyed rectangles
but also on a less obvious note it cant generate individuals that have attributes out of a 0-1 range unless you do it manually by hand.

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

It was easy to understand the positioning and workings of the rectangles, positioning the eyes and manipulating them though was kind of hard.
My plans changed from going in depth and playing with shapes to instead just messing around to understand the workings of the code we already had and to save my better ideas for the polished generator.

## **Generator 2:** what does this generate?

This one generates very interesting spiders in my opinion.

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

The most important qualities are the diverse attributes and ranges of spiders it can generate.
The interesting qualities are seeing what kind of spiders you can create by playing around with their sliders and the landmarks.
Also its fun to play the music and then press landmarks in time with the beat to watch the spiders dance to the music under your control.

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

size controls the size of the spiders

aspectRatio controls the aspect ratio of the spiders

angle controls the angle at which the spiders are displayed/bouncing

hue controls the color of the spiders

brightness controls the shade of the color of the spiders

fuzz controls how flashy / prominent the spiders legs/bodies are

these are relevant to this project because the idea is to be able to generate different types of content and the use of these sliders allows us to adjust the content and also allows attributes to be selected randomly.

## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

GettaLoadOfThisGuy: this one showcases how cute and tiny they can get

Fear: this one is scary

NobodyEverLooksUp: based off a true story (plays around with negative size)

AChallengerApproaches: a funny spider that looks like he is powered up/super saiyan

BlueBerry: its in the name

ImNormalandCanBeTrustedWithWeapons: he is normal and can be trusted

dont: spider jumpscare

ThisIsntEvenMyFinalForm: terrifying overpowered spider

they differ from eachother by showcasing the kind of spiders you can get when playing around with the spiders and their dna

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things _can't_ it generate?

Anything other than spiders.
More seriously, it really focuses on colorful flashy size changing spiders and cant generate anything other than those really.

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

Finding an interesting design was challenging before I remembered I could borrow open source code.
Originally I also wanted to use the eye code from Kate but then trying to implement them and fit them on the spiders and position them proved to be very very difficult so instead I built off the eye code
that was on the site I borrowed from and integrated it into the existing attributes we had for eyes and then made eight of them and aligned them.

## Which generator has a more interesting possibility space?

The spider generator

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

I got the spider body shape code from https://happycoding.io/examples/p5js/using-variables/spider
I also built my generators off the starter code from Kate
as well as the googly eye code from Kate.

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later
