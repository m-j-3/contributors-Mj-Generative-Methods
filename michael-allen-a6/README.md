## Describe your bot's character

Grumpy, defeatest, tired, existentialist, does not want to be here but realises they have no control over it.
In more words: I want my bots character to be someone who had just woke up and just wanted to go back to sleep and that it was only awake because you were bothering it, therefore it is awake and only talks to you if you make it otherwise it goes back to sleep.

## How does the user know what to say to this bot How are you solving the blank slate problem?

I provide hints as well as having the bot respond to common conversation starters

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

I styled my page with colors that relate to sleepiness and framed the chat as if it was a calming picture or I like to think of it as like a bed frame with the inside being the bed, I also gave my bot a sleepy profile picture.


## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to. What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

Goodmorning phrases, its expressive range is grumpy and sleepy pretty flat, monotone responses

## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

Goodnight phrases, with which is responds with stereotypical goodnight phrases back as well as some sleepy emojis which is pretty monotone keeping the grumpy vibe 

## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

common conversation starters, with which it responds with reluctance and a very low desire to engage with you to portray the sleep grumpy annoyed vibe it has

## Describe the fourth thing this bot can respond to

being forceably woken up, where it complains sleepily about being woken up

## Describe the fifth thing this bot can respond to

The person idling without actively talking to it, this causes it to become annoyed and go to sleep
also if the person says anything without specific triggers the bot just complains grumpily about being tired and sleepy.

## What states does this bot move through? Is this a common social script? Why do the states connect like that?

It starts with its origin which is it waking up, then if conversation is initiated you can talk to it and it replies sarcastically to you and then if you say goodnight or use the night related chips it goes to sleep
also at any point if you just stare at the bot and dont say anything it goes back to sleep, I would say its a common social script at least in the way that it emulates human day cycle.
I made the states connect like that because I wanted my bots character to be someone who had just woke up and just wanted to go back to sleep and that it was only awake because you were bothering it, therefore it is awake and only talks to you if you make it otherwise it goes back to sleep.

## In what ways does your bot obey or subvert the Gricean maxims

My bot obeys the maxims of quantity and quality by keeping its responses mostly abrupt and saying the bare minimum it can, it also does not lie,  it subverts relation and manner by being overly flowery with its language sometimes and by general trying to not stay on topic.
## What 3 other bots did you look at? What was interesting, notable or useful about them?

Neural net guesses memes
ca-dmv
hashfacade
I also love neural net guesses memes because its funny to see all its mistakes but its also awesome when it gets it right
the ca-dmv bot is just funny because you get to see all the reasoning behind the dmvs acception or rejection of license plates.
I think hashfacade is interesting because its an idea weve all thought about with colours from words and this bot is out there showing us it all.
