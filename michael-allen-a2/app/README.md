## Describe each of the four GIFs 
Color Wheel: It is an oscillating circle composed of a bunch of other smaller circles that are chagning colors.

Pretty squiggly circles: they are two circles changing colors and size giving off the illusion they are bouncing from corner to corner when 
in actuallity its a loop of one circle going diagnolly down across the screen and another one going diagnially up across the screen

Stare Into The Abyss And The Abyss Stares Back: A hypnotizing rainbow ring around a dark abyssal eye gazing at you and you feel yourself sinking into the abyss

Maggots: two thousand little squiggly worms changing colors hallucinatory 
(inspired by higurashi where a character has hallucinations of maggots under her skin and the scene is tinted in the color red) 
## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

I liked using noStroke and fill alot because it allowed you to vary the colours and I'm a big fan of the rainbow colour changing gifs
and noStroke allows everything to blend prettily without borders
I also liked messing with polar motion.

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?
 
p.stroke() was interesting to mess around with but I didn't really end up sticking with using it


## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?
 
I got it it to loop smoothly by using optical illusions, I believe is the term, I made it appear as though the circles were bouncing when really they just
went through the screen but because the two diagnol motions overlapped it gave the appearance of bouncing.
It was easy to just copy the code and change the direction but making sure the motion continued through the screen by drawing the circles for the bounds was tricky.

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

I used some base code from the example Prof. Compton gave us on canvas 

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later
