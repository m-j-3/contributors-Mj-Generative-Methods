## Which systems behaved like you expected? Which ones surprised you? In which ones did your initial idea evolve into something different?

Boids worked like how I expected but the spring system surprised me with the way it ended up working. My inital idea for the wind system ended up evolving from trying to imitate the leaves to deciding try and make it look like some sort of eldritch realm.

## Describe your 1st system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

my first system uses a force that attracts the snowballs towards the mouses, its emergent behavior at high speeds is for it to devolve into an extremely intense snowball fight and all of them disappearing eventually, at lower speeds they just move really prettily around the mouse super slow.
Its defferent from the smaple code in that i changed the intensity of the force and changed the emergent behavior of it

## Describe your 2nd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

my 2nd system is similar to the first except I changed the design and made its emergent behavior different so that it forms a puffy cloud like shape instead of crazy snowballs. Its forces are attraction to the mouse position.

## Describe your 3rd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

My third system uses the wind force idea, its emergent behavior is relatively static with the oscillating black slices just spinning and changing size forever.

## Describe your 4th system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

My fourth system is a cross between boids and rocket forces i really liked playing with rockets so I thought it would be fun to make a flock of them and have them repel against eachother while also maintaining the functionality of player input for thrust and turn forces. Its emergent behavior depends on what the player does with the controls but it does also contain attraction towards the mouse so it follows the mouse if no rocket forces.

## Which system has one particle uses "particle-to-all-particles" forces (Boids style) or reads a map (Braitenberg-style). Explain how.

Rocketboids, there is a cohesion force to keep them nearby i.e. towards the center of the flock, and a seperation force pushing them away from eachother as well as a slight alignment force.

## Which system has particles that leave a trail or creates new particles

Rocketboids creates new particles

## Which system interacts with user behavior, and how?

all of them react to mouse user behavior and the any system with rockets responds to user clicks by spawning more rockets, and two of the rocket systems are playable, i.e. respond to user input from the arrow keys.

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

I got help from the discord as well as building my code off of the starter code from Kate.

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later
