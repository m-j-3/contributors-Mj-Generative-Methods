## Your name

Michael Allen

## Your Glitch link

[my page](https://michael-allen-a1.glitch.me)

## What data sources are you using? Link the API/Kaggle/etc pages

I am combining https://github.com/Lazzaro83/Solar-System/blob/master/planets.json
as well as https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/science/planets.json

## Describe the format of the data

--your answer here (e.g, what kinds of data structures is it in? What properties does it have?) --

## How did you pre-process your data, if at all?

I pre-processed my data by storing my data into a class with all of the components I wanted to display on each swatch for the gallery of planets
## How are you visualizing the data?

As a gallery of planets with their moons orbiting them, with the speed of the moons determined by the planets orbital velocity, populated with the data from the jsons

## What did you notice about this data that you didn't anticipate?

I noticed that for the lesser known dwarf planets that they didn't collect much data so I collected it myself, I also noticed it was interesting how different the planet's speeds and distances are, the solar system is very vast.

## What do you want the visitor to your page to understand about this data?

I want the visitor to my page to be able to learn and grasp the information about the planets thats portrayed to them simply .

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

Starter code from Kate

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later
